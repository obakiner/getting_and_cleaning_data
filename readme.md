Below are described the main units of analysis, variables and measurement units for this project.
Unit of analysis: activity by subject, where subjectID (the integer-class subjects) can assume six activities, found in activityType (Walking, Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs, Sitting, Standing, and Laying). The activities are also listed as integers from 1 to 6 in the column named activityID.

Variables and units: each variable is a measurement mean per subject activity. The variables are either mean time or mean frequency. 

Abbreviations:  the abbreviations for each variable as follows. 
Acc: Acceleration
Gyro: Gyroscope
Mag: Magnitude
